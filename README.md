This is a program that simulates a solution for the "Dining Philosophers" problem by using semaphores.
There are 5 chopsticks at the table (one between each pair of adjacent philosophers).
In order to eat, a philosopher must acquire both the chopsticks adjacent to them. If they cannot, they are made to wait until they can.
